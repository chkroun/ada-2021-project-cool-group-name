## What makes a quote in the newspaper viral ?

In a world where the internet allows speaking to millions of people, we want to identify what factors can be linked to someone effectively reaching huge audiences. 
To measure how many people are reached by a quote we will use the number of repetition of said quote in newspapers. 
By analysing the characteristics of extremely viral quotes we want to try building guidelines to optimize the chance of a quote reaching a wider range of people. 
These guidelines would constitute very interesting tools for politicians and influencers as they would allow to better choose the topic and the speaker delivering a concept to increate the likelihood of being heavily quoted.
